          <p>I am from Cape Town, South Africa and I have been trading on the exchange market since 2016. I was introduce to the field by a close friend who was also trading at the time. I had a great interest in the field and wanted to know more. Over months of learning the skill, I became very frustated with myself due to the fact that I have learned all the concepts required, however, I have been unsucessful more often than not because I was not emotionally equiped to make the correct decisions. I then decided to find a way to automate the entire process in such a way that removes any emotional intereference from myself. I have since learned how to code and build algorithmic trading robots that can assist you in making the correct decisions with no hassle of the emotional factors.</p>
